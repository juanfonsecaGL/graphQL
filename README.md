Notes and exercises for Postman's Pooja Mistry's GraphQL training [1].

## History
* Facebook developed GraphQL in 2012.

## Benefits [2]
* Avoids data under and over-fetching by letting the consumers specify what information they want to receive.
* Minimizes the impact of changes on the API as (i) consumers specify the schema of the query, and (ii) user performs all operations using the same endpoint.

## Characteristics
* GraphQL operations are queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
    * Queries: fetch data (like GET).
    * Mutations: create or update data (like POST or PUT).
    * Subscriptions: bi-directional communications (?).
